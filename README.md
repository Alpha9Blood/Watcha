**Program Overview**

The program appears to be a graphical user interface (GUI) application, likely built using the Tkinter library in Python. The program is designed to manage and track anime/manga-related data, including anime lists, episodes, scores, and links.

**Functionality**

1. **Anime/Manga Management**: The program allows users to manage their anime lists, including adding, removing, and updating anime entries.
2. **Episode/Chapters Tracking**: Users can track episodes for each anime, including setting the current episode and updating the episode count.
3. **Score Management**: Users can assign scores to each anime and update them as needed.

**Classes and Modules**

1. **SalameGUI**: This class appears to be the main GUI class, responsible for creating and managing the application's interface.
2. **WatchaScript**: This module contains functions and classes related to anime data management, including updating links and retrieving anime data.
3. **GUI_Index**: This module contains constants and enumerations used throughout the program, such as button indices and text indices.
4. **MangaScript**: This module contains functions and classes related to manga data management, including updating links and retrieving manga data.

**Myself**

I could improve this in various aspects, but for now i think it's usable, and this is more than i wanted when started building this.
This has more of a test to learn python and the creation of database and graphical interface than a true project and it looks ok for me.
