**Program Overview**

The program appears to be a graphical user interface (GUI) application, likely built using the Tkinter library in Python. The program is designed to manage and track anime-related data, including anime lists, episodes, scores, and links to MyAnimeList.

**Key Features**

1. **Anime Management**: The program allows users to manage their anime lists, including adding, removing, and updating anime entries.
2. **Episode Tracking**: Users can track episodes for each anime, including setting the current episode and updating the episode count.
3. **Score Management**: Users can assign scores to each anime and update them as needed.

**Classes and Modules**

1. **SalameGUI**: This class appears to be the main GUI class, responsible for creating and managing the application's interface.
2. **TextManager**: This class is used to manage text elements within the GUI, including labels and text boxes.
3. **WatchaScript**: This module contains functions and classes related to anime data management, including updating MyAnimeList links and retrieving anime data.
4. **GUI_Index**: This module contains constants and enumerations used throughout the program, such as button indices and text indices.

**Functionality**

The program's functionality can be summarized as follows:

1. Users can create and manage their anime lists, including adding, removing, and updating anime entries.
2. Users can track episodes for each anime, including setting the current episode and updating the episode count.
3. Users can assign scores to each anime and update them as needed.
5. Users can customize the GUI to suit their preferences.

**Myself**

I could improve this in various aspects, but for now i think it's usable and this is more than i wanted when i started building this.

This has more of a test to learn python and creation of database and graphical interface than a true project and looks ok for me.

I plan to implement support for Manga later.
